    st.write("Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' finance team wants to forecast sales in all of their stores across multiple cities six weeks in advance. Individual store managers forecast sales using their years of experience as well as their personal judgment. Promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality were identified as necessary factors for predicting sales across the various stores by the data team. TheÂ job is to create and maintain an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to the finance team's analysts.")
